          Hi, my name is Jessica Sarah Gross. I am twenty-seven years old and I currently reside
          in Bayside, Queens. I am a graduate of Benjamin N. Cardozo Highschool and Queensborough Community College.
          My hobbies include swimming, video games, listening to music and reading. I also like  learning to program.
          I recently started learning to code this year. I've learned some fundamentals such as HTML5 and CSS, as well as
          some OOP languages such as C++ and a scripting language called JavaScript. I've also learned how to use a version
          control system such as Git and Github. I've found coding to be challenging, but also very rewarding. I can't wait to
          see the future of technology and know that I'm apart of this great evolution.
          <br><br>
          These are examples of projects that I've completed on my journey in learning web development.<br>
