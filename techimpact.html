    <h2>TechIMPACT</h2>
    <p>
      Technology is very important to the future development of our societty. It can be implemented
      in many fields such as Medicine, Business, Design, Marketing, Entertainment etc... It is used to
      solve problems and has a huge impact on our day to day lives and will effect the lives of future generations.
      <br><br>
      TechIMPACT is a very important program that provides a tuition-free training program in becoming a software engineer.
      I believe that I would ve a perfect candidate for the program because I am very self driven. I am passionate about becoming
      a programmer and have not stopped my learning process since I've made that decision. It is my dream to be able to attend a
      top coding bootcamp such as Software Guild (that will be sponsoring  the TechIMPACT program). I would love to be apart of the
      Software Guild and learn Java and C#. Java is one of the most used languages in the software engineering field. Development
      in Android phones is mostly created using the programming language Java.
